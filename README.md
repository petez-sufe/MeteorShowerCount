# Meteor Shower Data Plotter 
Hi, human beings! It's December again, which means we can enjoy one of the biggest meteor showers very soon!

I am a college student interested in python and astronomy, so I decided to write a short program to graph the average number of visual meteor on an hourly basis.

The data I am using is from International Meteor Organization. You can download any visual meteor database you like.
The data is free but you need to register as a free member first.
The link: https://www.imo.net/members/imo_vmdb/download

I put the data files in one directory and the program will read through the directory. Be sure there are no other data or files in the directory.
